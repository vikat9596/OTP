# OTP Input Component

A React component for entering One-Time Passwords (OTPs) with customizable length.

## Overview

This component provides a simple way to input OTPs typically used for authentication purposes. It consists of a series of input fields where users can enter numeric characters. Navigation between input fields is automated based on user input.

### Features

- Allows entry of OTPs of configurable length.
- Automatically moves focus to the next input field upon character input.
- Supports Backspace and Delete keys for clearing input.
- Validates input to ensure only numeric characters are accepted.

## Usage

1. **Installation**

   First, ensure you have React installed in your project. Then, you can install the OTP component using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install --save otp-input-react
   # or
   yarn add otp-input-react
   ```

2. **Example**

   Import the OTP component into your React application and use it as follows:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import OTPInput from 'otp-input-react';

   const App = () => {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>Enter OTP</h1>
               <OTPInput otpLength={6} />
           </div>
       );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

   Adjust `otpLength` prop as needed to change the number of OTP digits.

3. **Props**

   - `otpLength` (optional): Number of OTP digits to input (default: 6).

4. **Styling**

   The component can be styled using CSS classes or inline styles as per your project's design requirements.
